<step name="handle_partial_wave_execution">
If `WAVE_FILTER` was used, re-run plan discovery after execution:

```bash
POST_PLAN_INDEX=$(gsd_run query phase-plan-index "${PHASE_NUMBER}")
```

Apply the same "incomplete" filtering rules as earlier:
- ignore plans with `has_summary: true`
- if `--gaps-only`, only consider `gap_closure: true` plans

**If incomplete plans still remain anywhere in the phase:**
- STOP here
- Do NOT run phase verification
- Do NOT mark the phase complete in ROADMAP/STATE
- Present:

```markdown
## Wave {WAVE_FILTER} Complete

Selected wave finished successfully. This phase still has incomplete plans, so phase-level verification and completion were intentionally skipped.

/gsd:execute-phase {phase} ${GSD_WS}                # Continue remaining waves
/gsd:execute-phase {phase} --wave {next} ${GSD_WS}  # Run the next wave explicitly
```

**If no incomplete plans remain after the selected wave finishes:**
- continue with the normal phase-level verification and completion flow below
- this means the selected wave happened to be the last remaining work in the phase
</step>

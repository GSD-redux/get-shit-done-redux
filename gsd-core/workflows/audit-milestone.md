INIT=$(gsd_run query init.milestone-op)
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
AGENT_SKILLS_CHECKER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-integration-checker)
```

Extract from init JSON: `milestone_version`, `milestone_name`, `phase_count`, `completed_phases`, `commit_docs`.

Resolve integration checker model:
```bash
integration_checker_model=$(gsd_run query resolve-model gsd-integration-checker --raw)
```

## 1. Determine Milestone Scope

```bash
# Get phases in milestone (sorted numerically, handles decimals)
gsd_run query phases.list
```

- Parse version from arguments or detect current from ROADMAP.md
- Identify all phase directories in scope
- Extract milestone definition of done from ROADMAP.md
- Extract requirements mapped to this milestone from REQUIREMENTS.md

## 2. Read All Phase Verifications

For each phase directory, read the VERIFICATION.md:

```bash
# For each phase, use find-phase to resolve the directory (handles archived phases)
PHASE_INFO=$(gsd_run query find-phase 01 --raw)
# Extract directory from JSON, then read VERIFICATION.md from that directory
# Repeat for each phase number from ROADMAP.md
```

From each VERIFICATION.md, extract:
- **Status:** passed | gaps_found
- **Critical gaps:** (if any — these are blockers)
- **Non-critical gaps:** tech debt, deferred items, warnings
- **Anti-patterns found:** TODOs, stubs, placeholders
- **Requirements coverage:** which requirements satisfied/blocked

If a phase is missing VERIFICATION.md, flag it as "unverified phase" — this is a blocker.

## 3. Spawn Integration Checker

With phase context collected:

Extract `MILESTONE_REQ_IDS` from REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table — all REQ-IDs assigned to phases in this milestone.

Print: "Spawning integration checker (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze)"

<!-- #2517 model-omit-on-inherit -->

> **Model omission (#2517).** Omit the `model` parameter entirely when the value it would carry (`integration_checker_model`) is `"inherit"` or empty. An empty value 404s on runtimes without native tier aliases — the default on non-Claude runtimes. Omitting it inherits the orchestrator's model. See @gsd-core/references/model-profile-resolution.md.

```

> **Runtime-aware dispatch (#2508 Phase 4).** GSD workflows dispatch specialized subagents by role. Before dispatching on a built-in-only runtime (kimi-code — three built-ins only), resolve the role to a built-in via `gsd_run query resolve-dispatch-type --requested <role> --raw`. On named-dispatch runtimes (Claude/OpenCode/…) the role is returned unchanged; on kimi-code it maps to `coder`/`explore`/`plan` by role-suffix. The persona rides `${AGENT_SKILLS_<ROLE>}` (Phase 3) regardless. See @gsd-core/references/runtime-aware-dispatch.md.

```

> **ORCHESTRATOR RULE — CODEX RUNTIME**: After calling Agent() above, stop working on this task immediately. Do not read more files, edit code, or run tests related to this task while the subagent is active. Wait for the subagent to return its result. This prevents duplicate work, conflicting edits, and wasted context. Only resume when the subagent result is available.

## 4. Collect Results

Combine:
- Phase-level gaps and tech debt (from step 2)
- Integration checker's report (wiring gaps, broken flows)

## 5. Check Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

MUST cross-reference three independent sources for each requirement:

### 5a. Parse REQUIREMENTS.md Traceability Table

Extract all REQ-IDs mapped to milestone phases from the traceability table:
- Requirement ID, description, assigned phase, current status, checked-off state (`[x]` vs `[ ]`)

### 5b. Parse Phase VERIFICATION.md Requirements Tables

For each phase's VERIFICATION.md, extract the expanded requirements table:
- Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence
- Map each entry back to its REQ-ID

### 5c. Extract SUMMARY.md Frontmatter Cross-Check

For each phase's SUMMARY.md, extract `requirements-completed` from YAML frontmatter:
```bash
# #2962: zsh aborts the block on an unmatched for-list glob (nomatch); bash passes it through. nullglob both.
shopt -s nullglob 2>/dev/null; setopt NULL_GLOB 2>/dev/null

for summary in .planning/phases/*-*/*-SUMMARY.md; do
  [ -e "$summary" ] || continue
  gsd_run query summary-extract "$summary" --fields requirements_completed --pick requirements_completed
done
```

### 5d. Status Determination Matrix

For each REQ-ID, determine status using all three sources:

| VERIFICATION.md Status | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | → Final Status |
|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| passed                 | listed              | `[x]`           | **satisfied**  |
| passed                 | listed              | `[ ]`           | **satisfied** (update checkbox) |
| passed                 | missing             | any             | **partial** (verify manually) |
| gaps_found             | any                 | any             | **unsatisfied** |
| missing                | listed              | any             | **partial** (verification gap) |
| missing                | missing             | any             | **unsatisfied** |

### 5e. FAIL Gate and Orphan Detection

**REQUIRED:** Any `unsatisfied` requirement MUST force `gaps_found` status on the milestone audit.

**Orphan detection:** Requirements present in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table but absent from ALL phase VERIFICATION.md files MUST be flagged as orphaned. Orphaned requirements are treated as `unsatisfied` — they were assigned but never verified by any phase.

## 5.5. Nyquist Compliance Discovery

Skip if the Nyquist capability is inactive.

```bash
VERIFY_POST_HOOKS_JSON=$(gsd_run loop render-hooks verify:post --raw)
```

Resolve active step hooks from `VERIFY_POST_HOOKS_JSON` where `kind == "step"` and `ref.skill == "validate-phase"`.

If no active validate-phase step hook exists: skip entirely.

For each phase directory, check `*-VALIDATION.md`. If exists, parse frontmatter (`status`, `nyquist_compliant`, `wave_0_complete`).

Classify per phase:

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| COMPLIANT | `status: validated` and `nyquist_compliant: true` and all tasks green |
| PARTIAL | `status: validated` and (`nyquist_compliant: false` or red/pending) |
| NOT-VALIDATED | `status: draft` (or absent) — validate-phase has not yet reconciled this file (#2117) |
| MISSING | No VALIDATION.md |

> **NOT-VALIDATED vs PARTIAL (#2117):** A phase reads `status: draft` when it was seeded by plan-phase but never reconciled by validate-phase, OR when its `VALIDATION.md` predates the `status` field (files written before #2117 stay `draft` whether or not validation ran). In both cases `nyquist_compliant` is not authoritative, so this is a coverage TODO ("run validate-phase") — not a compliance failure. Re-running validate-phase promotes the file to `status: validated` and yields the real COMPLIANT/PARTIAL verdict. Only `status: validated` + `nyquist_compliant: false` is a genuine PARTIAL.

Add to audit YAML: `nyquist: { compliant_phases, partial_phases, not_validated_phases, missing_phases, overall }`

Discovery only — never auto-calls `/gsd:validate-phase`.

## 6. Aggregate into v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md

Create `.planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` with:

```yaml
---
milestone: {version}
audited: {timestamp}
status: passed | gaps_found | tech_debt
scores:
  requirements: N/M
  phases: N/M
  integration: N/M
  flows: N/M
gaps:  # Critical blockers
  requirements:
    - id: "{REQ-ID}"
      status: "unsatisfied | partial | orphaned"
      phase: "{assigned phase}"
      claimed_by_plans: ["{plan files that reference this requirement}"]
      completed_by_plans: ["{plan files whose SUMMARY marks it complete}"]
      verification_status: "passed | gaps_found | missing | orphaned"
      evidence: "{specific evidence or lack thereof}"
  integration: [...]
  flows: [...]
tech_debt:  # Non-critical, deferred
  - phase: 01-auth
    items:
      - "TODO: add rate limiting"
      - "Warning: no password strength validation"
  - phase: 03-dashboard
    items:
      - "Deferred: mobile responsive layout"
---
```

Plus full markdown report with tables for requirements, phases, integration, tech debt.

**Status values:**
- `passed` — all requirements met, no critical gaps, minimal tech debt
- `gaps_found` — critical blockers exist
- `tech_debt` — no blockers but accumulated deferred items need review

## 7. Present Results

Route by status (see `<offer_next>`).

</process>

<offer_next>
Output this markdown directly (not as a code block). Route based on status:

---

**If passed:**

## ✓ Milestone {version} — Audit Passed

**Score:** {N}/{M} requirements satisfied
**Report:** .planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md

All requirements covered. Cross-phase integration verified. E2E flows complete.

---

## ▶ Next Up — [${PROJECT_CODE}] ${PROJECT_TITLE}

**Complete milestone** — archive and tag

/clear then:

/gsd:complete-milestone {version}

---

---

**If gaps_found:**

## ⚠ Milestone {version} — Gaps Found

**Score:** {N}/{M} requirements satisfied
**Report:** .planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md

### Unsatisfied Requirements

{For each unsatisfied requirement:}
- **{REQ-ID}: {description}** (Phase {X})
  - {reason}

### Cross-Phase Issues

{For each integration gap:}
- **{from} → {to}:** {issue}

### Broken Flows

{For each flow gap:}
- **{flow name}:** breaks at {step}

### Nyquist Coverage

| Phase | VALIDATION.md | Compliant | Action |
|-------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| {phase} | exists/missing | true/false/partial | `/gsd:validate-phase {N}` |

Phases needing validation: run `/gsd:validate-phase {N}` for each flagged phase.

---

## ▶ Next Up — [${PROJECT_CODE}] ${PROJECT_TITLE}

**Close the gaps inline** — gap planning happens as part of this audit's
output (see the Unsatisfied Requirements, Cross-Phase Issues, Broken Flows,
and Nyquist Coverage sections above). Insert one closure phase per gap (or
per group of related gaps) using the standard phase chain:

/clear then:

/gsd:phase --insert <N> "Close gap: <REQ-ID> — <description>"
/gsd:discuss-phase <N>
/gsd:plan-phase <N>
/gsd:execute-phase <N>

For Nyquist-coverage gaps flagged in the table above, prefer running
`/gsd:validate-phase <N>` for each flagged phase (and `/gsd:secure-phase
<N>` if SECURITY.md was flagged) before inserting a new closure phase —
they may close the gap retroactively without a new phase.

---

**Also available:**
- cat .planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md — see full report
- /gsd:complete-milestone {version} — proceed anyway (accept tech debt)

---

---

**If tech_debt (no blockers but accumulated debt):**

## ⚡ Milestone {version} — Tech Debt Review

**Score:** {N}/{M} requirements satisfied
**Report:** .planning/v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md

All requirements met. No critical blockers. Accumulated tech debt needs review.

### Tech Debt by Phase

{For each phase with debt:}
**Phase {X}: {name}**
- {item 1}
- {item 2}

### Total: {N} items across {M} phases

---

## ▶ Options

**A. Complete milestone** — accept debt, track in backlog

/gsd:complete-milestone {version}

**B. Plan a cleanup phase** — address the debt above before completing.
Insert a closure phase using the standard chain:

/clear then:

/gsd:phase --insert <N> "Address tech debt: <area>"
/gsd:discuss-phase <N>
/gsd:plan-phase <N>
/gsd:execute-phase <N>

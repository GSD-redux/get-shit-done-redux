**Step 5.5: Plan-checker loop (only when `$VALIDATE_MODE`)**

Skip this step entirely if NOT `$VALIDATE_MODE`.

 GSD ► CHECKING PLAN

◆ Spawning plan checker... (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze)
```

Checker prompt:

```markdown
<verification_context>
**Mode:** quick-full
**Task Description:** ${DESCRIPTION}

<files_to_read>
- ${QUICK_DIR}/${quick_id}-PLAN.md (Plan to verify)
</files_to_read>

${AGENT_SKILLS_CHECKER}

**Scope:** This is a quick task, not a full phase. Skip checks that require a ROADMAP phase goal.
</verification_context>

<check_dimensions>
- Requirement coverage: Does the plan address the task description?
- Task completeness: Do tasks have files, action, verify, done fields?
- Key links: Are referenced files real?
- Scope sanity: Is this appropriately sized for a quick task (1-3 tasks)?
- must_haves derivation: Are must_haves traceable to the task description?

Skip: cross-plan deps (single plan), ROADMAP alignment
${DISCUSS_MODE ? '- Context compliance: Does the plan honor locked decisions from CONTEXT.md?' : '- Skip: context compliance (no CONTEXT.md)'}
</check_dimensions>

<expected_output>
- ## VERIFICATION PASSED — all checks pass
- ## ISSUES FOUND — structured issue list
</expected_output>
```

> **ORCHESTRATOR RULE — CODEX RUNTIME**: After calling Agent() above, stop working on this task immediately. Do not read more files, edit code, or run tests related to this task while the subagent is active. Wait for the subagent to return its result. This prevents duplicate work, conflicting edits, and wasted context. Only resume when the subagent result is available.

**Handle checker return:**

- **`## VERIFICATION PASSED`:** Display confirmation, proceed to step 6.
- **`## ISSUES FOUND`:** Display issues, check iteration count, enter revision loop.

**Revision loop (max 2 iterations):**

Track `iteration_count` (starts at 1 after initial plan + check).

**If iteration_count < 2:**

Display: `Sending back to planner for revision... (iteration ${N}/2)`

Revision prompt:

```markdown
<revision_context>
**Mode:** quick-full (revision)

<files_to_read>
- ${QUICK_DIR}/${quick_id}-PLAN.md (Existing plan)
</files_to_read>

${AGENT_SKILLS_PLANNER}

**Checker issues:** ${structured_issues_from_checker}

</revision_context>

<instructions>
Make targeted updates to address checker issues.
Do NOT replan from scratch unless issues are fundamental.
Return what changed.
</instructions>

After planner returns → spawn checker again, increment iteration_count.

**If iteration_count >= 2:**

Display: `Max iterations reached. ${N} issues remain:` + issue list

Offer: 1) Force proceed, 2) Abort

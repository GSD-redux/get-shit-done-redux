**Step 3: Research phase (only when `$RESEARCH_MODE`)**

Skip this step entirely if NOT `$RESEARCH_MODE`.

Dispatched BEFORE planning, for every not-yet-researched item in the batch —
row 16 of the design's behavior table. Research is not worktree-isolated (it
only writes `${item_dir}/${quick_id}-RESEARCH.md`, never touches git), so the
`isolation == none` concurrency cap (row 6) does NOT apply here (row 12) —
compute concurrency with `mutating=false`:

```bash
QB_RESEARCH_CONC_JSON=$(gsd_run quick-batch effective-concurrency --jobs "$JOBS" --task-count "$ITEM_COUNT" --capacity "$CAPACITY" --isolation "$ISOLATION" --raw)
RESEARCH_CONCURRENCY=$(printf '%s' "$QB_RESEARCH_CONC_JSON" | node -e 'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>{try{const j=JSON.parse(s);process.stdout.write(String(j.concurrency))}catch{process.stdout.write("1")}})')
```

For each item in `$BATCH_MANIFEST_JSON.items` whose
`${item_dir}/${quick_id}-RESEARCH.md` does not already exist on disk (idempotent
— a resumed batch skips items already researched): derive `$item_dir` the same
way every step does —

```bash
SLUG=$(gsd_run query generate-slug "$description" --raw)
ITEM_DIR="${quick_dir}/${quick_id}-${SLUG}"
mkdir -p "$ITEM_DIR"
```

### GSD ► RESEARCHING QUICK BATCH ITEMS
◆ Investigating approaches for ${ITEM_COUNT} item(s) (runs in subagents — no output until each returns, ~1–5 min each; expected, not a freeze)
```

Dispatch one `Agent()` PER MESSAGE, `run_in_background: true`, up to
`$RESEARCH_CONCURRENCY` in flight at once — never multiple `Agent()` calls in
one message (mirrors `execute-phase.md`'s own wave-dispatch discipline):

```
Agent(
  prompt="
<research_context>

**Mode:** quick-batch-item
**Task:** ${description}
**Output:** ${ITEM_DIR}/${quick_id}-RESEARCH.md

<required_reading>
- ${STATE_PATH} (Project state — what's already built)
- ${PROJECT_PATH} (Project context)
- ./CLAUDE.md or ./.claude/CLAUDE.md (if exists — project-specific guidelines)
</required_reading>

${AGENT_SKILLS_RESEARCHER}

</research_context>

<focus>
This is one item of a quick-batch, not a full phase. Research should be concise and targeted:
1. Best libraries/patterns for this specific item
2. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
3. Integration points with existing codebase
Do NOT produce a full domain survey. Target 1-2 pages of actionable findings.
</focus>

<output>
Write research to: ${ITEM_DIR}/${quick_id}-RESEARCH.md
Return: ## RESEARCH COMPLETE with file path
</output>
",
  subagent_type="gsd-phase-researcher",
  model="{researcher_model}",
  description="Research: ${description}"
)
```

> **ORCHESTRATOR RULE — CODEX RUNTIME**: After dispatching all researchers for this round, wait for every one to return before continuing. Do not read more files, edit code, or run tests while any researcher is active.

Wait for all dispatched researchers to return before proceeding. If a
researcher does not produce `${item_dir}/${quick_id}-RESEARCH.md`, warn but
continue — mirrors `/gsd:quick`'s own tolerant fallback (research is
advisory input to planning, never a hard gate).

Continue to Step 4 once every item has either a RESEARCH.md or a logged
warning.

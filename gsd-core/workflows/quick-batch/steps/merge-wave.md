**Step 7: Deterministic merge**

Skip entirely if `$ISOLATION == "none"` — nothing was worktree-isolated,
there is nothing to merge (executors already committed to the primary
checkout in Step 6).

**Merge rounds.** Repeat until no wave has a mergeable prefix left (bounded
by `$ITEM_COUNT` rounds):

1. For each DISTINCT `wave` value present among items that are
   `status == "pending"` with a `${item_dir}/${quick_id}-SUMMARY.md` on disk
   (executor returned) and NOT yet merged: build `$WAVE_ORDER_JSON` — the
   `quick_id`s of every item AT THAT WAVE, in `$BATCH_MANIFEST_JSON.items`
   array order (this IS the order `computeWaves`/`partitionByFileOverlap`
   assigned — never re-sort it).

2. Build `$READY_JSON` — the subset of that wave's items whose
   `SUMMARY.md` already exists (an executor may still be mid-flight for a
   sibling in the same wave; row 33 — merges happen strictly in wave order,
   an out-of-order finisher waits):
   ```bash
   QB_MERGE_ELIG_JSON=$(gsd_run quick-batch merge-eligible --wave-order "$WAVE_ORDER_JSON" --ready "$READY_JSON" --raw)
   ```
   Parse `mergeable` — the PREFIX of `$WAVE_ORDER_JSON` currently mergeable.
   If empty, skip this wave this round (its first item hasn't finished yet).

3. **Build the cleanup-wave manifest for `mergeable`, IN THAT ORDER** — fresh
   from each item's own PLAN.md, never from `BATCH.json`'s `planned_files`
   alone (Open Question 2's accepted resolution). `$mergeable` is a bash
   ARRAY (parsed from the JSON `mergeable` array) — never a plain
   space-joined string, which re-splits unpredictably between bash and zsh
   (#4109):
   ```bash
   for quick_id in "${mergeable[@]}"; do
     PLAN_CONTENT=$(cat "${ITEM_DIR}/${quick_id}-PLAN.md")
     ENTRY_JSON=$(gsd_run quick-batch cleanup-entry \
       --agent-id "agent-${quick_id}" \
       --worktree-path "$WT_PATH" \
       --branch "$WT_BRANCH" \
       --expected-base "$EXPECTED_BASE" \
       --allowed-bases '["'"$EXPECTED_BASE"'"]' \
       --plan-content "$PLAN_CONTENT" --raw)
     # append $ENTRY_JSON to the merge manifest's "entries" array, in order
   done
   ```
   (`$WT_PATH`/`$WT_BRANCH`/`$EXPECTED_BASE` per item come from the recorded
   `$QUICK_BATCH_WORKTREE_MANIFEST` entry Step 6 wrote for that `agent_id`.)

4. **Merge, one at a time, via the SAME bounded primitive every other worktree
   consumer uses** (never hand-roll `git merge`):
   ```bash
   QB_CLEANUP_RESULT=$(gsd_run query worktree.cleanup-wave --manifest "$MERGE_MANIFEST_PATH" --raw) || true
   ```
   `executeWorktreeWaveCleanupPlan` isolates each entry's failure by default
   (a blocked entry does not stop the rest of the manifest) except the one
   carve-out where the repo is left genuinely mid-merge, which halts the
   remaining entries in THIS manifest — resume picks them up on the next
   round/invocation.

5. **Route each entry's result:**
   - `status == "merged_removed"`: success. Mark the item's completion pending
     (Step 9 calls `quick-batch complete` for it — do NOT call it here; a
     `--validate` item still has verification ahead of it).
   - Any other status: route via
     ```bash
     gsd_run quick-batch merge-routing --kind merge_failed --detail "$reason" --raw
     ```
     (or `--kind scope_violation` when `$reason` names an undeclared
     deletion — `partitionDeclaredDeletions`'s own guard). The routing result
     always carries `preserveWorktree: true` — do NOT remove the worktree or
     branch for this item; leave it for diagnosis (row 28/34/35). Do NOT call
     `quick-batch complete` for it. Continue with the rest of the batch (row
     33 — unrelated items are unaffected).

Continue to Step 9 (`--validate` routes through the verification step first)
once every wave with a mergeable prefix has been processed this round.
